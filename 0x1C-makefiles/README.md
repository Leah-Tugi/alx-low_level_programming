# C - Makefiles

In this project, I practiced writing Makefiles.

* **5. Island Perimeter**
  * [5-island_perimeter.py](./5-island_perimeter.py): Python function that returns the
  perimeter of an island defined in a grid.
  * Prototype: `def island_perimeter(grid):`
  * The parameter `grid` is a list of a list of integers.
    * Water is represented by `0`.
    * Land is represented by `1`.
    * Each element of the lists represents a cell square of side length 1.
    * Grid cells are connected horizontally/verticaly (not diagonally).
    * The grid is rectangular, with a width and height not exceeding 100.
    * The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is either exactly
    one island or nothing.
    * The island does not contain lakes (water inside disconnected from
    surrounding land).

* **6. make -f 100-Makefile**
  * [100-Makefile](./100-Makefile): Makefile that creates an executable `holberton` based on
  [school.c](./holberton.c) and [main.c](./main.c). Builds on [4-Makefile](./4-Makefile)
  with:
    * Does not define the variable `RM`.
    * Never uses the string `$(CFLAGS)`.
    * Does not compile if the header `m.h` is missing.
    * Works even if there are existing files of the same name as any of the
    Makefile rules in the current directory.
